# MyGin Web Framework

## Getting started
With [Go module](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) support, simply add the following import

```
import "github.com/scott-pb/mygin"
```

to your code, and then `go [build|run|test]` will automatically fetch the necessary dependencies.

Otherwise, run the following Go command to install the `gin` package:

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/scott-pb/mygin
```
